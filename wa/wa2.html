	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>My name is Annalie Haralson! (she/her) </p>
	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I'm a Junior in <b>Integrated Design Engineering</b>. I'm studying electrical engineering with an emphasis in <b>CTD</b>! I also am pursuing a certificate in <b>Engineering Leadership</b>.</p>
	<p>When I'm not in school I like to spend most of my time outside, especially skiing, climbing, and hiking. Currently I'm working on completing all the trails in Boulder in a year! I play percussion and enjoy making music with friends. </p>
	<h2>Learning Goals for Web</h2>
	<p>I don't have any experience working with HMTL or CSS so I'm excited to be able to design my own website, especially the aesthetics of it.</p>
